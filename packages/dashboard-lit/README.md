# OpenClaw Dashboard (Lit)

Lightweight Lit + Vite dashboard for the OpenClaw gateway. Overview and Chat views with WebSocket connection to the gateway.

## Run

```bash
pnpm dashboard-lit:dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 (or the port Vite prints).

Use localhost (or HTTPS) only. Device identity signing requires a secure browser context.

In the **Connection** panel:

- Gateway URL defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`
- Paste your gateway shared secret (token/password)
- Click **Connect**
- If auto-reconnect fails repeatedly, use **Connect now** to force an immediate retry

If you see `unauthorized: gateway password mismatch`:

- Run `openclaw config get gateway.auth.password`
- If empty, run `openclaw config get gateway.auth.token`
- Paste that value into the shared secret field and reconnect

## Security hardening for Control UI

```bash
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth false
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth false
openclaw config set gateway.auth.mode password
openclaw config set gateway.auth.password
openclaw config set gateway.tailscale.mode funnel
openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins '["http://localhost:5174","http://127.0.0.1:5174"]'
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm dashboard-lit:build
```

Output in `packages/dashboard-lit/dist/`.

## Env

- `VITE_GATEWAY_URL` – WebSocket URL (default: `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`)
- `OPENCLAW_CONTROL_UI_BASE_PATH` – Base path for deployment (e.g. `/dashboard`)
