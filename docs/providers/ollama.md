# Ollama

Ollama is a local LLM runtime that makes it easy to run open-source models on your machine. Clawdbot integrates with Ollama's OpenAI-compatible API and can **auto-discover tool-capable models** when enabled via `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (or an auth profile) and no explicit `models.providers.ollama` config is set.

## Quick start

1) Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai

2) Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.3
# or
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
# or
ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b
```

3) Enable Ollama for Clawdbot (any value works; Ollama doesn't require a real key):

```bash
# Set environment variable
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="ollama-local"

# Or configure in your config file
clawdbot config set models.providers.ollama.apiKey "ollama-local"
```

4) Use Ollama models:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "ollama/llama3.3" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Model Discovery

When Ollama is enabled via `OLLAMA_API_KEY` (or an auth profile) and no explicit `models.providers.ollama` entry exists, Clawdbot automatically detects models installed on your Ollama instance by querying `/api/tags` and `/api/show` at `http://localhost:11434`. It only keeps models that report tool support, so you don't need to manually configure them.

To see what models are available:

```bash
ollama list
clawdbot models list
```

To add a new model, simply pull it with Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

The new model will be automatically discovered and available to use.

If you set `models.providers.ollama` explicitly, auto-discovery is skipped. Define your models manually in that case.

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

The simplest way to enable Ollama is via environment variable:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="ollama-local"
```

### Custom Base URL

If Ollama is running on a different host or port (note: explicit config skips auto-discovery, so define models manually):

```json5
{
  models: {
    providers: {
      ollama: {
        apiKey: "ollama-local",
        baseUrl: "http://192.168.1.100:11434/v1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Model Selection

Once configured, all your Ollama models are available:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "ollama/llama3.3",
        fallback: ["ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced

### Reasoning Models

Models with "r1" or "reasoning" in their name are automatically detected as reasoning models and will use extended thinking features:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b
```

### Model Costs

Ollama is free and runs locally, so all model costs are set to $0.

### Context Windows

Ollama models use default context windows. You can customize these in your provider configuration if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama not detected

Make sure Ollama is running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

And that the API is accessible:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### No models available

Pull at least one model:

```bash
ollama list  # See what's installed
ollama pull llama3.3  # Pull a model
```

### Connection refused

Check that Ollama is running on the correct port:

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ps aux | grep ollama

# Or restart Ollama
ollama serve
```
