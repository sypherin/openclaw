# `clawdbot daemon`

Manage the Gateway daemon (background service).

Note: `clawdbot daemon …` is the preferred surface for Gateway service management; `daemon` remains
as a legacy alias for compatibility.

Tip: run `clawdbot daemon --help` for platform-specific flags.

Notes:
- `daemon status` supports `--json` for scripting.
- `daemon install|uninstall|start|stop|restart` support `--json` for scripting (default output stays human-friendly).
