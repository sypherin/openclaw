# `clawdbot doctor`

Health checks + quick fixes for the gateway and channels.

Related:

- Security audit: [Security](/gateway/security)

## Examples

```bash
clawdbot doctor
clawdbot doctor --repair
clawdbot doctor --deep
```

## macOS: `launchctl` env overrides

If you previously ran `launchctl setenv CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN ...` (or `...PASSWORD`), that value overrides your config file and can cause persistent “unauthorized” errors.

```bash
launchctl getenv CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl getenv CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD

launchctl unsetenv CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN
launchctl unsetenv CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD
```
