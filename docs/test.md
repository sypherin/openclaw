# Tests

- `pnpm test:force`: Kills any lingering gateway process holding the default control port, then runs the full Vitest suite with an isolated gateway port so server tests don’t collide with a running instance. Use this when a prior gateway run left port 18789 occupied.
- `pnpm test:coverage`: Runs Vitest with V8 coverage. Global thresholds are 70% lines/branches/functions/statements. Coverage excludes integration-heavy entrypoints (CLI wiring, gateway/telegram bridges, webchat static server) to keep the target focused on unit-testable logic.
