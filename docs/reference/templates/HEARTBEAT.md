# HEARTBEAT.md

# Leave this file missing, empty, or comments-only if you don't want extra heartbeat guidance.

# Set agents.defaults.heartbeat.emptyFilePolicy: "run" if you want heartbeat to run even when this file is comments-only.

# Set agents.defaults.heartbeat.every: "0m" in config to disable heartbeat entirely.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.
