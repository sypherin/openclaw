# Config Builder (WIP)

This workspace package will host the standalone OpenClaw config builder app.

## Stack

Use the same front-end stack as the existing OpenClaw web UI (`ui/`):

- Vite
- Lit
- Plain CSS (no Next.js/Tailwind)

## Planning

Implementation details are tracked in `.local/config-builder-spec.md`.
